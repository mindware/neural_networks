# Neural Network

A simple neural network written in python to show how machine learning can help in automated classification. This is a simple Feed Forward Neural trained using Back Propagation, to classify a dummy dataset of flowers. Note: this code was originally written in a jupyter notebook. This is part of a series of quick programming excercises to show my son the basics of AI and warm up my machine learning skills. 
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need ipython, python3-tk and python3 installed. Optionally, you should install jupyter and run this via jupyter. Once you have those installed, clone this repository to your local machine.

```
apt-get update
apt-get install python3.6
apt-get install ipython
apt-get install python-tk
```

### Running it

```
ipython ff_bp_neural_network.py
```
